# Workforce Link Database API (Original)

This is the original prototype of the Node JS server API that I programmed for Workforce Link's IT system during 2019. It was a purely back-end solution so that our existing share-hosted website can make requests to the server so that we didn't have to migrate anything to different platforms.

The build is dated circa 26 November 2019 at 11:55am (AEST). Everything is exactly as it was except for personal information being redacted and placeholder files converted to markdown.

This API was designed to use the [Workforce Link client database](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev/worklink-database).

## Further Development

As of June 2021, I have decided to start cleaning up backup files of the IT system I designed for Workforce Link. On the 5th of August, I publicly released the database design, a 'Support Worker' test data generation script, and a prototype build of the final product.

These repositories are currently based on the original prototype and, as such, are only intended for reference and not proper usage. I will spend the coming months developing an improved version of the system from scratch. Revised versions of the database and test data generator will be developed and released alongside this new system.
